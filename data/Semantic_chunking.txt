Long sentences are challenging for natural language processing (NLP) applications. Especially when they're composed of multiple clauses, complex noun or verb phrases, relative clauses, and parenthetical groupings. Just like the human beholder, an NLP system also needs to successfully keep track of all the presented dependencies. The goal of semantic chunking is to find semantically coherent fragments of a sentence representation. These fragments can then be processed independently and recombined as semantic representations without loss of information, interpretation, or semantic relevance. The inherent meaning of the text is used as a guide for the chunking process.

Text data chunking strategies play a key role in optimizing the RAG response and performance. Fixed-sized and semantic are two distinct chunking methods:

Fixed-sized chunking. Most chunking strategies used in RAG today are based on fix-sized text segments known as chunks. Fixed-sized chunking is quick, easy, and effective with text that doesn't have a strong semantic structure such as logs and data. However it isn't recommended for text that requires semantic understanding and precise context. The fixed-size nature of the window can result in severing words, sentences, or paragraphs impeding comprehension and disrupting the flow of information and understanding.

Semantic chunking. This method divides the text into chunks based on semantic understanding. Division boundaries are focused on sentence subject and use significant computational algorithmically complex resources. However, it has the distinct advantage of maintaining semantic consistency within each chunk. It's useful for text summarization, sentiment analysis, and document classification tasks.
